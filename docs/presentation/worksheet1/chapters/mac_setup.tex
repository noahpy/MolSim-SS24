    \textbf{Problem:} xerces is not available on MacOS and code will be evaluated on a Linux system

    \textbf{Solution:} Clion offers remote toolchains to build, run, and debug project

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Similar to WSL described on problem sheet for Windows
        \item Create Docker container with Ubuntu base image and all necessary files and libraries
        \item Create a new toolchain in Clion
        \item Configure Clion's Cmake profile and configuration to use the created docker image
        \item Use the IDE as you normally would
        \item Even connect to the container via terminal to do intensive debugging
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Be aware that this approach will have its limits}
