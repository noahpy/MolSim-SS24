    \begin{itemize}
        \item Checkpointing by saving simulation state in XML format via \texttt{XmlWriter}
        \item First with thermostat: Slow descent and calm assimilation, interesting wave patterns!
        \item Without temperature regulation: Rapid fall and violent splash, significant wave reflection from boundaries!
        \item With periodic boundaries: Negligible differences, waves splash against each other like reflection boundary
    \end{itemize}
